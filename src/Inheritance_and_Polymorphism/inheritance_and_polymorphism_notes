abstraction - implementaion details can be abstracted away making code more readable
encapsulation - restriction of access to various levels of abstraction preventing data inconsistencies
inheritance - duplication is minimized though inheritance hierarchies
polymorphism - flexible code where multiple implementations may be swapped out behind a common interface

-- The Four Pillars of OOP --

1. Abstraction - keep it clean
2. Encapsulation - keep it contained
3. Inheritance - keep it hierarchical(DRY)
4. Polymorphism - keep it versatile
